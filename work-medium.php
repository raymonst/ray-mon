						<p><a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a> is a place where anyone can publish their ideas and find an audience among 170+ million readers on the platform. While there is an abundance of quality content, readers sometimes find it hard to read stories from writers and publications they enjoy. The existing experience relied heavily on algorithmically-ranked stories in a feed, which meant that readers see recommendations from all over Medium, but not always from the sources they explicitly follow. This also meant that writers and publications found it challenging to build an audience on Medium. <!-- To address this, we explored, designed, and built the next version of the Medium mobile app to solidify Medium&rsquo;s status as a place where ideas live and prosper??? --></p>

						</figure>
						<p>Users find Medium content from both internal sources (e.g. medium.com homepage, app, email digests) and external (e.g. social media, messaging, email). App users are a smaller group compared to web users, but they also tend to be more engaged with the product, i.e. they use the product more frequently, read more stories, etc.</p>
						<p>The existing app worked relatively fine. It served millions of users and drove a significant part of the business (via paid subscription). Over time, however, the content distribution had become <a href="https://ev.medium.com/toward-a-more-relational-medium-e801ff4653a4" target="_blank">more transactional and less relational</a>, which led to more headline-driven content and less robust discovery. Ultimately, this ran contrary to the company&rsquo;s mission and would have a deleterious impact on the user experience in the long term. This is especially important for paying members, who are at risk of attrition if they no longer find value in the content that Medium has to offer. Given that app users are smaller in number yet more highly engaged overall, we decided that the app would be a good place to test out our ideas before rolling out more globally. </p>

					<h2>SETTING THE STAGE</h2>

					<div class="container-section-item">
						<p>We started off with a &ldquo;north star&rdquo; design sprint to create a vision for the app experience. I led the overall effort and collaborated with three other designers from both the reader and creator experience teams. We focused our explorations on key surfaces (app home, writer/publication home, and story page) and investigated the following themes:
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Discovery</strong><br/>How might we help readers explore and discover content that&rsquo;s relevant to them and encourage them to build ongoing relationships with entities they find interesting?</li>
								<li><strong>Sense of place</strong><br/>How might we convey a sense of place, brand, and trust for both readers &amp; creators (writers &amp; publications) on the platform so they continue to find value in Medium?
								<li><strong>Story reading</strong><br/>How might we make reading stories more efficient and fluid so readers can discover more content with less friction?</li>
							</ul>

					<div class="container-section-item">
						<p>The output from the design sprint helped create alignment across the board and while the resulting designs weren’t final, they pointed in the right direction. Given the scale of this project, we thought it’d be useful to establish some core principles that would guide us along the way. Alexis Lloyd (VP Design) led this exercise with executives and we established the following principles:
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Context</strong><br/>As a reader, I know exactly where I am in Medium&rsquo;s ecosystem and I can navigate to/from other parts of Medium with confidence.</li>
								<li><strong>Continuity</strong><br/>As a reader, I can seamlessly move from one story to another (or from one writer/publication to another) with ease and I&rsquo;m always discovering something new on Medium.</li>
								<li><strong>Completion</strong><br/>As a reader, I feel a sense of accomplishment and learning after spending time on Medium. My time is well-spent and I&rsquo;m not consuming content endlessly.</li>
							</ul>							
						</p>
						<p>Redesigning a mobile app is no small feat, so to make it more manageable, we broke it down into smaller chunks that focus on specific parts of the experience and split this work among a few designers. We also planned out how we would test this with users along the way.</p>

					<h2>THE CORE READING EXPERIENCE</h2>
					<hr class="separator" />
				</aside>
				<section>
					<div class="container-section-item">
						<p>As a product, we want the reading experience on Medium to be as smooth as possible so the user can focus on the content. However, we wanted to make sure that <strong>context</strong> and <strong>continuity</strong> are an integral part of the new experience as well.</p>
						<figure class="image-size-xs image-alignment-r">
							<figcaption>old seamless gif</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>I proposed an initial idea to improve continuity by treating stories like a stack of cards where the user could seamlessly &ldquo;skip&rdquo; to the next story if desired. 
						<p>This tested fairly well with users in the initial round of testing, who adapted to the concept and began using the &ldquo;next&rdquo; button as a way to preview stories beyond the headlines. We eventually moved away from the &ldquo;stack of cards&rdquo; model, but this insight showed us that there was value in a slightly longer story preview, which gave the user a little more context in addition to the story title.</p>
						<p>After more explorations, we settled on a design where longer story previews are displayed one after another in the context of the writer/publication, and the full story is expanded inline within the same context. By doing so, the story&rsquo;s context is always clear and we enable the user to seamlessly discover other stories from the same entity simply by scrolling.</p>

					<h2>STREAMLINING THE APP ARCHITECTURE</h2>
					<hr class="separator" />
				</aside>
				<section>
					<div class="container-section-item">
						<p>We saw the redesign process as an opportunity to simplify the overall app architecture. Our usage data showed that the mobile app was primarily used for reading. Writers and publication editors may occasionally edit their stories or check their story stats in the app, but the majority of creator activities occurred on desktop web. As such, we didn&rsquo;t think that &ldquo;write&rdquo; warranted such a premium placement in the app&rsquo;s primary navigation bar. We moved it out of the nav bar and into the user&rsquo;s &ldquo;you&rdquo; tab, making it secondary but still fairly accessible.</p>
						<p>Our data also showed that <a href="https://medium.design/a-library-to-call-your-own-9c1fcdb6e4bc" target="_blank">reading list</a>, a place for the user&rsquo;s saved stories, was a heavily used feature but only by a small portion of app users. We didn&rsquo;t want to hide it completely, but placing it in the primary navigation bar didn&rsquo;t seem right for most users either. We eventually decided to put it on app home, which seemed to be the right compromise. Since home is the first surface in the app, users could still easily access the reading list if they wanted to, but those who don&rsquo;t use reading list aren&rsquo;t constantly seeing it in the primary nav bar.</p>

					<h2>HOME SWEET HOME</h2>

				<section>
					<div class="container-section-item">
						<p>App home is essential because it&rsquo;s the first thing users see when they open the app. The existing home experience relied heavily on the feed, which we wanted to reorient. We started by trying out a drastically different home, which showed writers/publications only (no stories) to reflect the entity-driven thinking. However, this didn&rsquo;t test well with users (during the first private beta). While this had the potential to surface previously unseen writers/publications, the lack of stories meant that the home surface got stale quickly.</p>
						<p>Realizing this, we aimed to strike a better balance between stories and entities in the iterations that followed. In addition, we looked into how editorial content could fit within the new home experience. We eventually landed on a version with a more balanced mix of content from the user&rsquo;s followed entities, recommended and trending stories, editorially selected stories, and curated writers & publications.</p>

						<p>This homepage was also designed with completion in mind. We prioritized creators that the user follows by listing them first on the page. When they publish, the user sees numbered badges that correspond to those new stories and the user could clear this by visiting the creator&rsquo;s page and reading their stories. We also removed the infinite feed and let the homepage reach an actual end, which would discourage users from scrolling endlessly.</p>

					<h2>LISTENING TO USERS</h2>

					<div class="container-section-item">
						<p>Research findings from the first private beta group helped shape the design and led us to a more robust version of the product. As we prepared for the second, larger private beta group, we wanted to include both qualitative and quantitative measures so we could get a more holistic understanding overall. In addition to the ongoing user interviews, we set up an in-app feedback form to get more user input and programmed events tracking in the beta app to capture user behavior. Researcher Laura Carroll also set up benchmark surveys to measure user satisfaction more broadly and consistently as the product continued to evolve.</p>
						<p>From this survey, we saw that a majority of respondents (58%) was either very or somewhat satisfied with the beta version of the app. On the other hand, we also received feedback around story discovery, with one user remarking that &ldquo;&hellip; [i]t&rsquo;s more difficult to find article suggestions as well as to bookmark to read later.&rdquo; We knew that moving away from the infinite feed would negatively impact some users who are used to discovering content that way. That said, we also measured other success metrics that would be more indicative of where the product was heading towards strategically.</p>

						</figure>
						<p>Initial quantitative results suggested that the new app experience drove entity affinity across the board. Users were generally following more creators and reading more content from said creators. It remained to be seen whether this would translate more broadly to all users, but early signs were promising.</p>

					<h2>OTHER KEY PARTS ???</h2>
					<hr class="separator" />
				</aside>

					<div class="container-section-item">
						<p>As the core app experience began to settle, we started addressing other key app experiences that were critical for launch. One of these was the experience for non-member users, who can only read a limited number of paywalled stories each month. Non-members need to be crystal clear on how many stories they have left before having to upgrade to a paid membership and they should never use up their free story by accident. To address this, I intentionally added some friction to the non-member reading experience so they&rsquo;re in control of their reading choices on Medium.</p>

							<figcaption>Meter + Paywall Non-members have to tap twice to load a paywalled story. In certain cases, friction in the experience is desired.</figcaption>

						<p>As designers on the reader experience group worked through the app designs, there was a parallel effort happening on the creator side to <a href="https://blog.medium.com/a-more-expressive-medium-483e567b19ff" target="_blank">enable more expressiveness</a> and establish a better sense of place, context, and brand for their work on Medium. Naturally, readers need to see this as they read content from various creators in the app. The creator&rsquo;s creative decisions needed to be translated into the app experience. However, the app environment differed slightly from its web counterpart and had its own constraints. To get around these limitations, we decided that the app&rsquo;s official first version would only show key parts of the customization (with future plans to implement themes in full).</p>

						<p>Medium&rsquo;s product changes were accompanied by an <a href="https://blog.medium.com/a-more-expressive-medium-starting-with-medium-63b562206d8f" target="_blank">evolved brand</a> that conveys the openness of the platform. This brand identity is an integral part of Medium&rsquo;s future direction and as such, must be communicated through all product surfaces. I collaborated with the brand team to design and implement this language in product (which included significant changes to typography, colors, and illustration styles), and coordinated subsequent efforts with other designers and scrum teams on the product side for final implementation.</p>

						</figure>
						<p>All the product and brand changes that happened during this process strained our existing design system. We found that some of the components, semantics, and structure we had been using no longer served our product needs and as a result, we decided to make some fundamental updates to the system. I then conducted an audit across all our product surfaces and stress-tested the proposed changes to ensure the system was robust enough for current uses, but also flexible enough to accommodate future changes if needed.</p>
