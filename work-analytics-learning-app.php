						<p>Einstein Analytics Studio gives Salesforce customers the ability to build analytics dashboards and apps. While the tool is incredibly powerful, it can be intimidating for users, especially those with little analytics and/or Salesforce experience.</p>
						<p>The Learning Adventure app alleviates this gap in knowledge. For the beginner users, it provides best practice examples so the users can pick the right visualizations for their data and audience. And for the more advanced users, it provides plain language explanations and code examples behind dynamic visualizations, which they can repurpose in their own apps. More importantly, these examples are built and shown in situ, which allows users to learn from real hands-on examples.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>This is so meta, the[y] built a suite of dashboards to teach you how to build dashboards. I love it! Very clean, easy to follow, and well made.</p>
							<span>&mdash;Peter Lyons, Senior Associate at Huron Consulting Group</span>
						</blockquote>
						<p>The learning app is one manifestation of the larger &ldquo;learning journeys&rdquo; design effort in Salesforce. It originated as a one-off solution specific to Einstein Analytics, but given its success, we are looking into how to replicate this learning experience in other products.</p>
